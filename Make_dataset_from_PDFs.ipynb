        "Introduction\n",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic, a public health emergency of unprecedented scale and consequences, has revealed vulnerabilities in our health care system and public health infrastructure, yet also serves as a remarkable learning opportunity for transformational changes. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic touch every aspect of life in ways not previously imagined—the biomedical and health research enterprises are no exception. Preexisting stresses in the research sector’s workforce, processes, and organizations have been exacerbated in the sector’s quest to effectively generate meaningful information in response to the pandemic and deliver research in new and innovative ways. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the necessity to enhance the ability for researchers to share data through interoperable and customizable systems to enable rigor, reproducibility, and efficiency. This properly stewarded data essential for research is available and actionable, but trust remains a critical issue in establishing and maintaining data sharing entities [147].\n",
        "Despite the rapid innovation occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic, longstanding problems remain. The disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases and outcomes amongst lower-income populations and communities of color underscores the need to address the lack of diversity of clinical research participants as a top priority. The type of causal, clinical, and population-related intervention studies that may have a critical impact on outcomes in this pandemic necessitated the inclusion of a large, diverse pool of participants most adversely affected and traditionally underrepresented in research. Government funding focused on community engagement in research can certainly be a lever to promote diversity in study participation, as regulatory bodies seek to ensure the safety and efficacy of therapies across diverse populations [151].\n",
        "This paper describes the current status of research and the challenges, lessons learned, and the potential, if the challenges are overcome, for a longer-term impact beyond the pandemic to enhance the resilience and diversity of the biomedical research workforce.\n",
        "These lessons learned can also be applied to help advance the rapid translation of research into practice (from basic science to clinical and population settings to applied public health), promote the sharing of data for delivering near real-time results in a clinical setting, and elevate community and participants as equal partners in research.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview of the Research Landscape\n",
        "Within weeks of identifying a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 and its disease manifestation, COVID-19, institutions, researchers, public research funding agencies, and the private sector pivoted to critical research efforts across a broad continuum of COVID-19-related issues. The earliest efforts focused on uncovering the disease’s fundamental epidemiology (including public health surveillance studies to elucidate transmissibility) and analyzing data of new cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and demographic information (including age, race/ethnicity, and sex). Together with fundamental research of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, clinical research priorities also quickly emerged.\n",
        "Research discoveries generally aligned and emerged with the progression and priorities of the pandemic. During the initial weeks of the pandemic, clinical research began characterizing symptoms, clinical manifestations, outcomes, and risk factors for poor outcomes—an essential foundation for developing diagnostic and testing technologies, prevention (individual and social behaviors), and therapeutic approaches (e.g., pharmaceuticals). As the pandemic progressed, public-private collaborations for vaccine development and efforts in the private sector toward developing therapeutics and vaccines occurred at an unprecedented pace, enabled by a foundation of investment in basic science discoveries. In addition, health services and care delivery research efforts centered on necessary adaptations to health care. Underpinning these changes were the debates occurring in other areas of the research ecosystem.\n",
        "With the intensified focus on racial injustice and structural racism throughout the United States, dissemination research and implementation science proved to be critical avenues for research focused on underserved populations and those at greatest risk for the most severe disease outcomes [51,157]. These discussions included best practices to engage participants and communities to build trust in the process of research and subsequent scientific outcomes. Remarkable progress on the virus and the disease emerged because of the rapid pivots necessitated by the pandemic. Decades of research, much of it in targeted fundamental science, the great majority of it publicly funded, enabled these pivots, as well as post-pivot progress.\n",
        "Despite the many challenges, there were remarkable successes. Less than 11 months after SARS-CoV-2 was first discovered, at least two vaccines were developed, tested, and found to be more than 90 percent effective in pivotal trials [1]. Multiple large-scale treatment trials were completed, with some demonstrating therapeutic efficacy and others not. New large-scale diagnostic testing technologies were developed and launched. The success of vaccine research arguably exemplifies factors for success in biomedical research: prior basic science discoveries ready to be leveraged, existing infrastructure that can be repurposed when needed, and public-private partners who harmonize protocols, bring together existing networks, and share resources [1].\n",
        "As the nation’s largest public funder of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) leveraged existing infrastructure to establish a public-private framework for the goal of accelerating the development of therapeutic interventions, vaccines, and diagnostics through five strategies [2]:\n",
        "1. Invest in NIH and NIH-funded researchers to increase fundamental and foundational knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.\n",
        "2. Speed innovation in COVID-19 testing technologies through NIH’s recently launched Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative, which aims to deliver rapid, widely accessible testing strategies to the public [3].\n",
        "3. Participate in public-private partnerships, such as NIH’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) partnership, and federal partnerships such as Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to forge approaches that would speed identification, development, evaluation, and manufacture of promising candidate therapeutics and vaccines [4].\n",
        "4. Support studies on preventative treatments and behavioral and community prevention practices to identify and implement effective approaches for promoting individual and community safety.\n",
        "5. Ensure that diagnosis, treatment, and prevention options are accessible and available for underserved and vulnerable populations that have been at the greatest risk for the most severe disease threats.\n",
        "Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at the forefront of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, established The Science Agenda for COVID-19 to guide the development of the evidence base needed for public health actions, guidance, and policy to curb the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and ultimately bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end [5]. The agenda presents six priority areas:\n",
        "1. COVID-19 disease detection, burden, and impact, especially as it relates to understanding disproportionate impacts on people at increased risk for health disparities and inequities;\n",
        "2. transmission of SARS-CoV-2;\n",
        "3. natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection;\n",
        "4. protection in health care and non-health care work settings;\n",
        "5. prevention, mitigation, and intervention strategies; and\n",
        "6. social, behavioral, and communication science.\n",
        "Other research funders, including non-profit entities, created research agendas focused on their unique missions and opportunities to contribute to the pandemic response. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) established efforts focused on adaptations to health care delivery and vulnerable populations through its engagement, comparative clinical effectiveness research, and dissemination and implementation purview. PCORI also established the large-scale Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes registry to understand the extensive impact of COVID-19 on the health and emotional well-being of both medical and nonmedical health care workers [149].\n",
        "Medical specialty societies, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America, identified priorities for COVID-19 research more broadly and funded several research efforts. Other such organizations did the same in areas related to the intersection of COVID-19 with diseases as their mission.\n",
