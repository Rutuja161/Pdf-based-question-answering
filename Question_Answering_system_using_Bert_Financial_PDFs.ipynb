Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning\\ninvestments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong\\nresults for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we\\ncontinue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to\\nmore easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine\\nlearning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion\\nCodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.”\\nHighlights\\nObsessing over the customer experience\\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,\\ndevelopers, enterprises, and creators.

The efforts resulted in more seized products, criminal referrals, and\\nindustry partnerships than ever before.

The company builds new products and services that\\ncustomers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better\\nin some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:\\n• Announced new AWS tools that make building with generative artificial intelligence (AI) easy, practical, and cost-\\neffective for organizations of all sizes. The tools include:\\n• Amazon Bedrock, a new managed service that offers customers the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-\\nready generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock provides easy access to leading foundation models (ultra-large machine learning models that generative AI relies on) from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, and\\nStability AI, as well as exclusive access to the Titan family of foundation models developed by AWS. Broad\\naccess to models gives customers flexibility and choice to customize and scale to their specific needs.\\n• Two next-generation compute offerings to deliver the lowest cost for training models and running inference in\\nthe cloud: the general availability of instances powered by AWS-designed Inferentia2 chips, AWS’s second-\\ngeneration accelerator, purpose-built for deep learning inference, as well as the general availability of\\nnetwork-optimized Trn1n instances for large, network-intensive models.

With this permit, Zoox completed an initial run of its\\nshuttle service for employees at its headquarters in Foster City, California, making it the first purpose-built robotaxi to\\noperate on public roads in California.\\n• Expanded the Ring lineup with new devices. Ring Battery Doorbell Plus offers improved HD video and energy-saving\\nfeatures, and Ring Peephole Cam is an apartment and renter-friendly video doorbell that easily installs over an existing\\ndoor peephole.\\n• Expanded the Amazon-built TV lineup with the Fire TV 2-Series, which makes getting an Alexa-enabled TV more\\naffordable than ever, and new sizes of the Omni QLED Series. The Omni QLED Series includes features so customers\\ncan see their schedule on the screen, control smart devices, and turn the TV into an in-home art gallery. Amazon has\\nsurpassed 200 million Fire TV devices sold globally. Amazon also launched Amazon-built TVs in Germany, Mexico,\\nand the UK, and collaborated with Cochlear to help people with hearing loss stream sound from their Amazon smart\\nTVs directly to their Cochlear hearing implants.\\n• Unveiled three customer terminal designs for Project Kuiper, Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative.\\nKuiper’s mission is to bridge the digital divide by providing fast, affordable broadband to communities worldwide that\\nare unserved or underserved by traditional technologies.

Amazon Sidewalk is a low-bandwidth, long-range community\\nnetwork that connects devices across long distances where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals often cannot reach. With\\nSidewalk coverage extending to 90% of the U.S. population, developers can now build and connect a new range of\\ndevices for the network.\\n• Launched a loyalty linking capability for Amazon One, Amazon’s palm recognition service that lets customers enter,\\nidentify, and pay. Panera is the first restaurant chain to offer the new loyalty linking capability, allowing customers to\\neasily enroll in and redeem rewards, and pay for their purchases with just their palm.\\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners.\\nFor example, in the first quarter, the company:\\n• Announced plans to spend $200 million on safety technologies across Amazon’s U.S. transportation network in 2023.\\nThese innovations include front-collision warning, lane-departure warning, speed limiters, and 360-degree camera\\ndetection systems. They are part of Amazon’s work to ensure that vehicles and delivery partners are safe on the road,\\nand the innovations are better for the environment.\\n• Announced that Amazon improved recordable incident rates worldwide by 11% from 2021 to 2022 and by almost 24%\\nfrom 2019 to 2022. The company shared the data in the second edition of its safety report, Delivered With Care, which\\ndetails how Amazon is advancing safety across its operations through investments in capital improvements, safetytechnology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and\\ncommunities.\\n• Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S.,\\nCanada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help\\nemployees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive\\ntasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.\\n• Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual\\nranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the\\nquality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.\\n• Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the\\nprogram participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and\\nconfidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.\\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities\\nin which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling\\nof the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\\n• Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and\\nSyria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local\\norganizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to\\nnon-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it\\neasy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.\\n• Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable\\nenergy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20\\ngigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate\\nbuyer of renewable energy for three years running.\\n• Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically\\nreduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million\\npackages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and\\nnow has thousands on the road.\\n• Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and\\nCapitol Heights, Maryland.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial\\nresults for its third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\\n• Net sales increased 13% to $143.1 billion in the third quarter, compared with $127.1 billion in third quarter 2022.\\nExcluding the $1.4 billion favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the\\nquarter, net sales increased 11% compared with third quarter 2022.\\n• North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $87.9 billion.\\n• International segment sales increased 16% year-over-year to $32.1 billion, or increased 11% excluding\\nchanges in foreign exchange rates.\\n• AWS segment sales increased 12% year-over-year to $23.1 billion.\\n• Operating income increased to $11.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter 2022.\\n• North America segment operating income was $4.3 billion, compared with an operating loss of $0.4 billion in\\nthird quarter 2022.\\n• International segment operating loss was $0.1 billion, compared with an operating loss of $2.5 billion in third\\nquarter 2022.\\n• AWS segment operating income was $7.0 billion, compared with operating income of $5.4 billion in third\\nquarter 2022.\\n• Net income increased to $9.9 billion in the third quarter, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared with $2.9 billion, or\\n$0.28 per diluted share, in third quarter 2022.\\n• Third quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $1.2 billion included in non-operating\\nincome (expense) from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax\\nvaluation gain of $1.1 billion from the investment in third quarter 2022.\\n• Operating cash flow increased 81% to $71.7 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $39.7 billion for\\nthe trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\\n• Free cash flow improved to an inflow of $21.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of\\n$19.7 billion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\\n• Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations improved to an inflow of\\n$15.9 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $28.5 billion for the trailing twelve months\\nended September 30, 2022.\\n• Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing\\nobligations improved to an inflow of $20.2 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $21.5\\nbillion for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2022.\\n“We had a strong third quarter as our cost to serve and speed of delivery in our Stores business took another step forward, our\\nAWS growth continued to stabilize, our Advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow\\nrose significantly,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “The benefits of moving from a single national fulfillment network in the\\nU.S. to eight distinct regions are exceeding our optimistic expectations, and perhaps most importantly, putting us on pace to\\ndeliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. The AWS team continues to innovate and deliver\\nat a rapid clip, particularly in generative AI, where the combination of our custom AI chips, Amazon Bedrock being the easiest\\nand most flexible way to build and deploy generative AI applications, and our coding companion (CodeWhisperer) allowing\\nenterprises to have the equivalent of an experienced engineer who understands all of their proprietary code is driving\\nmomentum with customers, including adidas, Booking.com, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines,\\nall of whom are starting to run generative AI workloads on AWS. Between AWS re:Invent and our 29th holiday shopping\\nseason, this is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come.”\\nHighlights\\nObsessing over the customer experience\\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services.\\nThis is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:\\n• Sold hundreds of millions of items worldwide during Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon’s largest two-day October\\nholiday kick-off event ever. Prime members across 19 countries saved more than $1 billion on millions of deals. On\\nthe first day of the event, U.S. Prime members purchased more than 25 million items with Same-Day or Next-Day\\nDelivery, with hundreds of thousands of items delivered within four hours of purchase.\\n• Announced new Buy with Prime features to help merchants grow their businesses on their own websites, such as the\\nability to integrate Buy with Prime with Shopify. The Buy with Prime app for Shopify will make it easier for Shopify\\nmerchants to manage their businesses, with inventory, pricing, and promotions automatically synced in one place.
